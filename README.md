# Tic Tac Toe 

This was `tic tac toe`, the [*9th project*](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) within the Odin Project curriculum and the 2nd one in the JavaScript course. This was my take on the classic tic-tac-toe game, and I implemented start, restart functionality alongside inputting player names by the user.
